# Baby-Bot
## Repository of files for Baby Bot as re-documented in '24

Code and data for Baby Bot which was demonstrated locally at my school and at a TechAstra 2K23 which was held locally in 2023. 

Fully coded in Python with a small output LED which showed the status of the listening process. 

Needs a good microphone. Can run on a Pi. But libraries are must. V1 code is most stable.

OpenAi Api key to be replaced by end user. 

Was made to work with a RPI 3A+ running Raspbian CLI with some additional Libraries installed. External Display was a Waveshare GPIO display with a touch panel (Touch never worked for me).
